# CloudTrail Log Analyzer

This is a simple Python tool I built to analyze AWS CloudTrail logs and flag key security-related events. Itâ€™s designed to help detect:

- Failed login attempts (`ConsoleLogin`)
- IAM activity like user creation or policy attachments (`CreateUser`, `AttachUserPolicy`)

The goal is to understand how log analysis works and build something practical for early-stage threat detection or audit review.
